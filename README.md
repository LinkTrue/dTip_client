# LinkTrue: Cryptocurrency links in bio, with confidence.
LinkTrue unifies your crypto links and wallet addresses on a single page, making it easier to receive crypto donations and tips securely and efficiently.

# Problem
Third-party bio link services seem convenient, but they control your data. You can’t verify their security, and your data might change without your knowledge.

# Solution
LinkTrue ensures data integrity—your data remains under your control, tied to your wallet, and securely stored on Ethereum Layer 2 Soneium, preventing tampering.

# Infrastructure
LinkTrue operates on Soneium, reducing costs while retaining the robust security and decentralization benefits of the Ethereum network.
