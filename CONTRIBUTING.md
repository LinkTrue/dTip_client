# Welcome Contributers

I'm happy to have you join me on the journey to build a useful and practical solution to help anyone to have his/her own crypto bank account! This project is all about humans. Whether you're a developer, a curious user, or an enthusiastic ambassador, I invite you to contribute in any way you can to achieve our common goal: financial inclusivity.

As someone who is tired of middlemen and the excessive fees that take away from our hard work, I believe this project can empower individuals to take control of their finances.

## Contributing Code

If you're interested in building new features, improving existing ones, adding tests, or anything else, I'd love to have you on board. Here's how to get started:

Check out the client application: https://github.com/LinkTrue/linktrue_client
and the Web3 smart contracts: https://github.com/LinkTrue/linktrue_web3

Review their source code and issues. If you have any ideas for improvement, please fork the repository and open a pull request. This lets others know you're working on something to prevent duplicate efforts. After a code review by maintainers (currently just me), your contributions will be merged and made available to everyone. Happy contributing, friend!

## Documenting and Sharing Knowledge

Documentation is crucial for the success of any project. If you have a knack for writing or enjoy sharing knowledge, consider contributing to our documentation. You can:

1. **Update existing documentation**: Help us keep our documentation up-to-date and accurate.
2. **Create new content**: Write tutorials, guides, or articles that showcase the project's capabilities.
3. **Translate content**: Help us reach a broader audience by translating our documentation into different languages.

## Becoming an Ambassador

As an ambassador, you'll play a vital role in spreading the word about our project. You can:

1. **Share your experience**: Write blog posts, create videos, or give talks about your experience with the project.
2. **Participate in events**: Represent the project at conferences, meetups, or online forums.
3. **Mentor newcomers**: Help others get started with the project and answer their questions.

## Other Ways to Help

There are many other ways to contribute beyond coding and documentation. Here are a few examples:

1. **Testing and feedback**: Try out new features and provide feedback to help us improve.
2. **Design and UX**: Help us create a better user experience through design suggestions and feedback.
3. **Community engagement**: Participate in discussions, answer questions, and engage with the community on our forums or social media channels.

I'm excited to have you on board and look forward to seeing your contributions!
