            question: "Is it really impossible to manipulate my data?",
            answer: "Your data is owned by your wallet address or your private key. If you lose them, then you lost the security guarantee. If you keep your wallet safe, then you have the promise of the Ethereum and its Layer 2 security. Itâ€™s worth mentioning that at the moment of writing this FAQ, $661M is the Total Value Locked on Optimism."
